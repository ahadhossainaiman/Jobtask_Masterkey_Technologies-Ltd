2. Vertical (`V`) and horizontal (`H`) split buttons.
3. Retain color for one partition; assign new color to new partition.
4. Recursive splitting of partitions.
5. Remove any partition using a `-` button.
6. Resizable partitions via click and drag.
7. Optional snapping to 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 ratios.
